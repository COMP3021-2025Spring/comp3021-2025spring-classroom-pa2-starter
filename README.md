# PA2 - LLM ChatManager

We have already practiced how to build a configurable persistence framework in the LLM ChatManager in PA1. Since we have
got the database containing thousands of serialized sessions, we can perform statistical analysis and generate profile
from them. In this PA, you will need to implement the profile functionalities in the `SessionManager` class.

## Demo

It's recommended to run and test with IntelliJ IDEA and OpenJDK 17. The project is written as a command line
Read-Eval-Print loop, you can run the application with the following command (or IDE-integrated application runner) to
play with it:

```bash
# play with the repl
./gradlew run
```

Here's a screencast of the application running:

TODO: add screencast

## Change Log

- PA0: Initial release, implement the basic functionalities of `ChatManager` and `ChatClient` and `GPT4oClient` class,
  design Task1 test cases
- PA1:
    - `ChatManager`: refine REPL, add history and list command
    - `ChatClient`: add persistence functionalities, add tag and description, add token statistics in Message
    - Add Interface `Serializable` for `ChatClient` and `Message`
    - Add annotations for guiding persistence
    - Add Task2 test cases
    - Code refactoring and bug fixing
- PA2:
    - Merge sessions into one file, add `UserID` for each session
    - `ChatManager`: add/update statistics commands: `report`, `history`, `tag`, `desc`
    - `ChatClient`: implement the `Stream` interface
    - Add `SessionManager` as the interface between ChatClient and session files.
    - Add PA2 test cases
    - Code refactoring and bug fixing

## Grading

In PA2, you need to implement the following methods, detailed implementation can be searched with "TODO" in the
codebase.

- You will be implementing the profile functionality in the `SessionManager` class, which is responsible for
  generating the profile from the session database.
- You are free to use provided utility methods in the `Utils` class, or implement your own helper methods.

We will provide public test cases for you to verify the correctness of your implementations. However, passing all the
public test cases does not mean that you can obtain the full mark for the PA. We also have many additional test cases as
the hidden ones, which are different from the ones we provided in the skeleton.

## Test

### Preparation

#### Download sessions database

Download the sessions database (~111MB) from [Canvas](https://canvas.ust.hk/files/10425403/download?download_frd=1) and save it as `db.json` under the project root directory.

#### Generate an API Key (optional)

:grey_exclamation: In this PA, you don't need to upload your api-key to GitHub to pass the testcases as required in
PA1. :grey_exclamation:

To run the application locally, you need to get an API key from
the [HKUST GenAI platform](https://itso.hkust.edu.hk/services/it-infrastructure/azure-openai-api-service) and replace
all the `apiKey` field in our provided session database into your encrypted api-key.

### Code style

To check the code style, run the following commands and make sure no warnings emitted.

```bash
./gradlew checkstyleMain
```

### Public test

To run PA2 public tests:

```bash
./gradlew test --tests "hk.ust.cse.comp3021.PA2Test"
```

The public test cases and their corresponding code are given below:

| Test Name               | Score | Related Methods/Statistics                                                                                                                                        |

| testAvgStatistics       | 10%   | generateProfile, `avgPromptTokens`, `avgCompletionTokens`, `avgTimeLastOpen`, `avgTimeLastExit`, `avgTimeCreated`, `avgTimeLastSessionDuration`, `avgTemperature` |
| testTopStringStatistics | 10%   | generateProfile, updateTopString, limitTopNString, `topTags`, `topModels`, `topWords`                                                                             |
| testGeneralStatistics   | 10%   | profile, generateProfile                                                                                                                                          |

### Private Test Cases

The private test will test a new statistic value in the profile called `sumPrice`. The value is computed as follows:

$$ sumPrice = \sum_{session} (totalPromptTokens \times unitPromptPrice + totalCompletionTokens \times unitCompletionPrice) \times modelSize $$

The unit of `modelSize` is 1B parameters. For example, model `wizardlm-13b` has a size of 13.

Besides, you should also pay attention to some edge cases like dealing with new user.

### Bonus

PA2's bonus task is open-ended. You can try to implement as more "functional" as possible. For example, implement with
less statements, more stream operations. For some function you can even try to implement using only one `return`
statement.

## Project Structure

:warning: Please check regularly for any updates from the skeleton repo. :warning:

:warning: Do not modify the project structure! :warning:

The project structure is as follows:

- `ChatManager` manages all `ChatClient`s, `repl()` is the entry point for the command-line REPL (outer REPL).
- `ChatClient` contains common implementation and specifies abstract methods, `repl()` is the entry point for the chat
  REPL (inner REPL).
    - Under `client/`, we have two concrete classes `GPT4oClient` and `GPT4ominiClient` that extends `ChatClient`, the
      `query()` method is used for interacting with the API service.
- `SessionManager` provide read/write/profile interface for the session database
- `Message` and `Messages` are used for storing chat messages.
- `Utils` contains some utility functions.
- `Serializable` is an interface for serialization and deserialization, implemented by `ChatClient` and `Message(s)`.
- `annotations/` contains annotations for guiding persistence.
- `exceptions/` contains exceptions corresponding to the annotations, four of them are inherited from
  `PersistenceException`.

## Academic Integrity

We trust that you are familiar with the Honor Code of HKUST. If not, refer
to [this page](https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp3021/#policy).

### Credit

- The project use [org.json](http://stleary.github.io/JSON-java/index.html) as the low-level JSON library for
  serialization and deserialization.
- Some annotations design is inspired by [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations)
- The session database is adapted from [lmsys-chat-1m](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmsys/lmsys-chat-1m), we choose
  20k sessions and convert to our sessions JSON format using the [script](./gen-dataset.py)
