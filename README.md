# PA2 - LLM ChatManager

Recently the LLM (Large Language Model) has become amazingly powerful and popular in the world. Several companies have
deployed their LLM chat services, such as ChatGPT from OpenAI. In this programming assignment, you are going to
implement a simple local chat manager (the `ChatManager` class) that can interact with different LLM chat clients (the
`ChatClient` class) and persist chat sessions.

## Change Log

- PA0: Initial release, implement the basic functionalities of `ChatManager` and `ChatClient` and `GPT4oClient` class,
  design Task1 test cases
- PA1:
    - `ChatManager`: refine REPL, add history and list command
    - `ChatClient`: add persistence functionalities, add tag and description, add token statistics in Message
    - Add Interface `Serializable` for `ChatClient` and `Message`
    - Add annotations for guiding persistence
    - Add Task2 test cases
    - Code refactoring and bug fixing
- PA2:
    - Merge sessions into one file, add `UserID` for each session
    - `ChatManager`: add/update statistics commands: `report`, `history`, `tag`, `desc`
    - `ChatClient`: implement the `Stream` interface
    - Add PA2 test cases
    - Code refactoring and bug fixing

## Grading

In PA1, you need to implement two tasks, detailed implementation can be searched with "TODO" in the codebase.

- Task 1: Implement `ChatManager` class and `ChatClient` class, implement the `query(String prompt)` method in `GPT4oChatClient` class.
- Task 2: Implement the persistence interface (`fromJson` and `toJson` in `Serializable`) in the `ChatManager` class and `ChatClient` class, and add annotations for guiding persistence.
- You are free to use provided utility methods in the `Utils` class, or implement your own methods.

We will provide public test cases for you to verify the correctness of your implementations. However, passing all the
public test cases does not mean that you can obtain the full mark for the PA. We also have many additional test cases as
the hidden ones, which are different from the ones we provided in the skeleton.

## Test

### Generate an API Key

To run/test the application, you need to get an API key from the LLM service provider. Below we list some useful
platforms for you to get the API key:

- (Recommended) GPT-4o: https://itso.hkust.edu.hk/services/it-infrastructure/azure-openai-api-service
- (Bonus) Deepseek: https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys
- (Bonus) Grok: https://docs.x.ai/docs/overview

To pass the test when using GitHub Action, you can either hardcode your API key in the code when creating new
`ChatClient` instance or write a script (for example: `echo xxx > keys/GPT-4o.txt`) to be called before each
`setup-command: ''` in [GitHub Actions Workflow](./.github/workflows/classroom.yml).

### Demo

It's recommended to run and test with IntelliJ IDEA and OpenJDK 17. The project is written as a command line
Read-Eval-Print loop, you can run the application with the following command (or IDE-integrated application runner) to
play with it:

```bash
# play with the repl
./gradlew run
```

Here's a screencast of the application running:

We use JUnit5 test to validate the correctness of individual methods that you need to implement, the specific test
commands and their corresponding task is given below:

```bash
# run all public tests
./gradlew test
# check coding style
./gradlew checkstyleMain
```

### Task1

```bash
./gradlew test --tests "hk.ust.cse.comp3021.Task1Test"

| Private Test Cases            | 15%   | the same scope of public test cases           |

### Private Test Cases

More specifically, the **private** test cases will test whether you implement the annotation in a generic way. For example,
you should not hardcode the field names and deal with the annotation, but use reflection to get the field types and
values and perform corresponding annotation actions. In the private test, we might add some unprecedented fields in
`ChatClient` and `Message` to test your implementation.

## Project Structure

:warning: Please check regularly for any updates from the skeleton repo. :warning:

:warning: Do not modify the project structure! :warning:

The project structure is as follows:

- `ChatManager` manages all `ChatClient`s, `repl()` is the entry point for the command-line REPL (outer REPL).
- `ChatClient` contains common implementation and specifies abstract methods, `repl()` is the entry point for the chat
  REPL (inner REPL).
    - `GPT4oClient` is a concrete class that extends `ChatClient`, `query()` is used for interacting with the API
      service.
- `Message` and `Messages` are used for storing chat messages.
- `GPT4oClient` is a concrete class that extends `ChatClient`, `query()` is used for interacting with the API service.
- `Utils` contains some utility functions.
- `Serializable` is an interface for serialization and deserialization, implemented by `ChatClient` and `Message(s)`.
- `annotations/` contains annotations for guiding persistence.
- `exceptions/` contains exceptions corresponding to the annotations, four of them are inherited from
  `PersistenceException`.
